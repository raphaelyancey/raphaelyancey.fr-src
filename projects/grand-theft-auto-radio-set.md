#### Ever dreamt about wandering through the radio stations like you were in the game?

<!-- featured image -->

***Grand Theft Auto* soundtracks are well known for their quality.** *Rockstar* did a great job at crafting the virtual radio stations, and you can even buy *Vice City*'s and *San Andreas*'s as CD box sets.

To make the experience more enjoyable â€” and learn a few things while I'm at it, **I decided to build a radio set that would act like it's picking up the game's stations.**

The main idea was to be able to scroll the frequency pot and move through the virtual stations, like I would with a standard radio. The main constraint was software-related: **I wanted the virtual stations to continue existing even if I was not listening to it.** Again, like in the real world.
