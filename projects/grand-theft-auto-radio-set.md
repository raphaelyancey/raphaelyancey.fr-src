#### Ever dream about wandering through the radio stations like you really were in San Andreas?

***Grand Theft Auto* soundtrack is well known for its high quality selection and funny interludes.** *Rockstar* did a great job at crafting the radio stations of the game, and you can even buy *Vice City*'s and *San Andreas*'s as CD box sets!

To make the experience more enjoyable ‚Äî and learn a few things while I'm at it, **I decided to hack a radio set to pick up the game's stations.**

The main idea was to be able to scroll the frequency pot and move through the virtual stations, like I would with a standard radio. The main constraint was software-related: **I wanted each virtual station to continue playing even if I was not listening to it.** Again, like in the real world.

Let's do this!

## 1. Hardware platform

I'd have gladly used an Arduino-like for this kind of portable, embedded project: it's less prone to fail because it's a much simpler architecture than SBCs (Single Board Computers).

But to play tens of files at the same time requires some guts so I settled on the **Raspberry Pi** single-board computer. Moreover, I already used it on several projects and am comfortable with it. Python would be the language of choice because I was in the mood. Do I need another reason? ü§î

## 2. Python software mixer

Then I needed to settle on a Python library that could:
- Handle **multiple audio sources**
- Have a **high-level interface to control these sources**

If I can load several files at once and control their volumes, **that's all I need to build a virtual radio**. Because that's basically what happens in the real world: each station is an audio source and the frequency pot changes the volume of these sources (from your ears point of view).

After much testing ([pygame-mixer](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html), [python-sounddevice](https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice/), [puredata](https://puredata.info/) with a mixer patch) and struggling **I settled on [swmixer](https://github.com/nwhitehead/swmixer)**. It can even stream the input files instead of loading it in full, which would be handy for me because **I planned to concatenate each station soundtrack into a single file**. But not being maintained anymore, [I forked it](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/swmixer) to patch a bug.

I choose to use a **Raspberry Pi 3** because the 2B was bottlenecking the audio output in some way. Didn't get too deep into why, as long as it worked better I moved to the next step...

## 3. High-level rotary encoders interface (meet [pyKY040](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/pyKY040))

![KY040 rotary encoders](https://i.imgur.com/xtY9Jx2.png)

The best Python library I found at the time for the KY040 rotary encoders I'm using was [KY040](https://github.com/martinohanlon/KY040) but I didn't quite fit my needs and I wanted to take a try on making my first real Python module, so I wrote [pyKY040](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/pyKY040).

> **Features**
> - Increment callback
> - Decrement callback
> - Change callback (increment or decrement)
> - Switch press callback
> 
> **Options**
> - Scale mode (internal counter is bound between X and Y, and is given as argument in the callback functions)
> - Looped scale mode (from X to Y, then X again)
> - Custom scale step

**It allows me to delegate the encoders logic and focus on what happens when I interact with it.**

The only lines you'll find about the encoders in the main script are:

```python
tuning_encoder = pyky040.Encoder(CLK=17, DT=27, SW=22)
tuning_encoder.setup(scale_min=MIN_VFREQ, scale_max=MAX_VFREQ, step=1, chg_callback=vfreq_changed)
tuning_thread = threading.Thread(target=tuning_encoder.watch)

volume_encoder = pyky040.Encoder(CLK=5, DT=6, SW=13)
volume_encoder.setup(scale_min=0, scale_max=10, step=1, inc_callback=inc_global_volume, dec_callback=dec_global_volume, sw_callback=toggle_mute)
global_volume_thread = threading.Thread(target=volume_encoder.watch)

tuning_thread.start()
global_volume_thread.start()
```

## 4. Virtual radio software ([code](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band))

Now that I could play files and had an interface with my encoders, **it was time to write the actual virtual radio software**.

**It acts like a virtual radio band.** On particular frequencies (or virtual frequencies a.k.a. *vfreqs*) you can hear audio playing ‚Äî they are *swmixer* channels. Between two *vfreqs*, you can hear a blend of their audio sources.

```
                                                                        
 Chn 1          Chn 2          Chn 3          Chn 4         Chn n        
   |              |              |              |             |         
   |--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|         
                                                                        
   <---------------------------------------------------------->         
                         virtual frequency                              
                                                                        
```

The virtual frequency is really only a integer, incremented or decremented based on your interaction with the tuning encoder.

To be free to adapt how the volumes are computed in-between two *vfreqs*, [it is handled by one function](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band/blob/master/src/main.py#L78-L105) that returns the volume that a channel should have for a given *vfreq*. Right now it's linear (see ASCII art below) but it can be modified to allow more noisy, unstable volume curve.

```
                                                             
                            VOLUME                           
      /-\                                           /-\     
   /-  | --\                                     /-- | --\  
--     |    --\                               /--    |    --
       |       --\                         /--       |       
       |          -\                     /-          |       
       |            --\               /--            |       
       |               --\         /--               |       
       |                  --\   /--                  |       
       |                     /--                     |       
       |                  /--   --\                  |       
       |               /--         --\               |       
       |            /--               --\            |       
       |          /-                     -\          |       
       |       /--                         --\       |       
 -\    |    /--                               --\    |    /- 
   --\ | /--                                     --\ | /--   
   -------------------------------------------------------   
       |                    vfreq                    |       
                                                             
 LOWER CHANNEL                                 UPPER CHANNEL 
     vfreq                                         vfreq     
```

When this example is applied to `CHANNEL n-1`, it overlaps with `CHANNEL n` and thus you get a blended audio (mix) from these two sources.

In pseudo-code, it looks like this:
```
when vfreq changes
    -> get the volumes to apply to each audio channel
    [
        -> get the volume for each channel
        [
            compute the nearby channels of the vfreq (lower and upper)
            if the channel is not one of those, its volume is 0
            else compute the channel volume given the vfreq
        ]
    ]
    -> apply these volumes
```
