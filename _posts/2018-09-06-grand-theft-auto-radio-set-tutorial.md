title: "Build your own GTA: San Andreas radio set"
---

<!-- TODO: update install script URL -->

By following this tutorial you'll be able to build a radio set with custom stations, in this case the *GTA: San Andreas* stations. [This is the original radio I built.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-radio-set.md %})

![The GTA:SA radio](https://i.imgur.com/QhesgDH.jpg)

Also works with other games / universes as long as you have the soundtrack (*Fallout* anyone üòè ?)

It uses [Virtual_FM_Band](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band) and [pyKY040](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/pyKY040), two Python programs I wrote for the occasion.

## Bill Of Materials (~$45)

- 1 * [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/Raspberry-Pi-3-Model-B-Plus-1-4GHz-Quad-Core-64Bit-1GB-RAM-2018-Model/261698200759) (might work on other SBC but not tested)
- 1 * 8GB (or more) [micro-SD card](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md)
- 1 * Vintage radio (at least 10.5 x 18.5 x 5.5mm ‚Äî keep the speaker!)
- 1 * [Small breadboard](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5pcs-Mini-Solderless-Prototype-Breadboard-SYB-170-170-Tie-points-For-Arduino-/253218642521)
- 2 * [KY040 encoder](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2pcs-KY-040-Rotary-Encoder-Module-for-Arduino-AVR-PIC-NEW/171906808593)
- 2 * [Encoders caps](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/10Pcs-6mm-D-Shaft-Hole-Knobs-Aluminum-Potentiometer-Pot-Caps-for-Electric-Guitar/112750148954)
- 1 * [USB DAC](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/USB-2-0-Adaptateur-USB-CARTE-SON-3D-5-1-AUDIO-MICRO-CASQUE-STEREO-EXTERNAL-/292654792250?oid=153077145613)
- 1 * [PAM8403 amplifier](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5PCS-Mini-Digital-Power-Amplifier-Board-PAM8403-Class-D-2-3W/171192554169) (or equivalent depending on your radio speaker)
- 1 * [Micro-USB panel mount](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/Micro-USB-2-0-Male-to-Female-connector-Adapter-Cable-30cm-With-Panel-Mount-Hole/391957934957) (male <> female)
- 18 * [DuPont prototyping wires](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/40-PCs-Dupont-Jumper-Wire-m-m-m-f-f-f-cable-pi-pic-pain-pour-Arduino/323094330106) (male <> female)
- 1 * [Male 1/8" TRS audio jack](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/10pcs-3-5mm-1-8-Audio-Male-Plug-Jack-Adapter-Connector-DIY-Earphone-SpeakerFE/232857668261)

And optionally for the tuning status LED:

- 1 * Red LED
- 1 * 100 Œ© resistor

... and some screws, bolts, wire, multimeter, spare DuPont headers & basic soldering tools that I'm guessing you already have. Also, a glue gun will be useful.

# Hardware

## 1. Empty the radio case

- Get rid of everything **but the speaker** and the pot caps if it has any. Read any indication on the speaker to buy the amplifier accordingly.

## 2. Solder the micro-USB panel mount to the Pi

- **Strip** the male socket part of the panel mount cable
- **Solder** the **positive** (red) wire to the **PP1** pad of the Raspberry Pi
- **Solder** the **negative** (black) wire to the **top of the socket** directly (the socket is grounded, and this way we avoid messing too much with the board if we want to re-use for another project)
- Put a little bit of **glue** on top of the socket solder to be sure the wire won't move

## 3. Build the speaker assembly

> Check out the [schematics below](#7-wire-it-up) to have a more general view of the wiring

- **Cut** and **strip** five small length wires: two for *amp <> speaker* and three for *Pi <> amp*

- Amplifier
  - **Solder** a 2-pins male DuPont header (bended, if you have) to the **amplifier 5V input**
  - **Connect two male <> female DuPont wires** to it and make it sturdy with electrical tape or thermo-retractable sheath

- Audio jack
  - Get the **audio jack** out of its plastic housing (we won't use it ‚Äî just keep the metallic part)
  - With the optional help of a multimeter, locate the *tip* (left audio channel), *ring* (right audio channel) and *sleeve* (ground) parts of the audio jack ([schema](https://robrobinette.com/images/Audio/TRS_Pinout_4_Wire.jpg))
  - **Solder wires** to each part
  - **Isolate it** and make it sturdy with electrical tape or sheath

- Speaker
  - **Solder** two wires to the speaker positive and negative poles

- Assembly
  - **Solder** the wire coming from the speaker **positive** pole to the amplifier **OUT L+** hole
  - **Solder** the wire coming from the speaker **negative** pole to the amplifier **OUT L-** hole (it could've been R+ and R- since the audio output will be mono, meaning both the left and right channel will output the same signal)
  - **Solder** the wire coming from the audio jack **tip** (left) to the amplifier **L** hole
  - **Solder** the wire coming from the audio jack **ring** (right) to the amplifier **R** hole
  - **Solder** the wire coming from the audio jack **sleeve** (ground) to the amplifier **‚èö** (ground) hole

**You now have the full speaker assembly** with an audio jack and two female DuPont wires ready to be plugged.

## 4. Build the status LED (optional)

- **Cut** two DuPont wires and keep the *female* part of each and **strip** the other part
- **Solder** one of the wires to the resistor
- **Solder** the resistor to the longest pin of the LED
- **Solder** the other wire to the other pin of the LED

## 5. Prepare the case

Here, **it will all depend on the shape of your radio case**. Just make sure you have enough space for the whole stuff by trying different layouts. When you think you're ready, then...

- **Drill** two holes for the encoders
- **Drill or cut** a rectangular hole for the micro-USB panel mount and two more holes aside it to screw it to the case

**Optional but very useful:** cut a hole for accessing the Pi micro-SD card without having to open the case.

## 6. Install everything

- **Install the encoders** in their holes and screw the bolts
- If you can, **screw the Pi to the case** so it won't move. Else, find some magic trick in your maker head!
- **Stick the breadboard** to the case
- **Screw the panel mount** to the case

**At this point**, you shouldn't any moving parts in the radio case except the speaker assembly: everything is either screwed or glued to the case.

## 7. Wire it up

- Follow the following wiring schema and if needed, get help from [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz) for identifying the pin numbers (BCM numbering is used across the project)

> The amp is here represented as an IC but really is a PCB like the one I linked in the bill of materials. Also, the male audio jack is represented as... a sticker (because these parts didn't exist in Fritzing)

![Wiring schematics](https://i.imgur.com/XvqQmSJ.png)

- If you're using the status LED, **plug** the DuPont wire soldered to the resistor to the [BCM 25 pin](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin22_gpio25#), and the other wire to a ground pin (either on the Pi or on the grounded rail of the breadboard)

- Remove the **USB DAC** plastic case to gain some space, and plug it into the Pi
- Plug the **audio jack** into the **USB DAC**

**The hardware part is done**, congratulations üéâ

# Software

## Flash Raspbian to a SD card

- Get the [latest **Raspbian Lite image**](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest)
- **Flash it** to the micro-SD card with e.g. [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
- Once flashed, remove it and put it back in your computer to be able to access the */boot* partition
- In a terminal, `cd` into the micro-SD card and type the following commands

```bash
touch ssh # To enable ssh at first boot
nano wpa_supplicant.conf # WiFi configuration at first boot
```

Paste the following (edit with your own informations):
```
country=YOUR_COUNTRY_ISO_CODE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
    ssid="YOUR_SSID"
    scan_ssid=1
    psk="YOUR_SSID_KEY"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

- **Eject/unmount** the micro-SD card and put it in the Raspberry Pi
- **Power on** the Raspberry Pi

**You should now (after ~30s) be able to `ssh` into your Raspberry Pi:** `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` (the password is *raspberry*).

> I strongly suggest you change the password of `pi` user or enable key file authentication at this point. The Pi won't be powered a lot but it costs nothing and prevent any harm!

## Install the software

- `ssh` into your Raspberry Pi
- **Run** the install script: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band/master/install.sh | bash`

The [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band/master/install.sh) installs packages, clone the virtual radio software, installs required Python modules and creates a cron to run the virtual radio at boot.

## Prepare and transfer the audio files

The way it's written at the moment, **the virtual radio software consider each file to be a whole station**. But you probably have multiple files into a folder for each station of your soundtrack, so we'll have to concate the files into one file.

> The files must be mono-channel MP3s at 44.1k rate

> You might have to use some bash-fu to avoid typing the command for each file, take a look at `find` and `xargs`!

**Audio manipulations** can be done with the `sox` swiss-army knife:
- For each file, run `sox file.ext -c 1 -r 44100 output/file.mp3`(this will convert to MP3, reduce to one channel and convert to 44.1k if not already)
- Considering you have an output folder per station, concatenate all the files into one with `sox file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.mp3 [...] STATION_NAME.mp3`

At this point, **you should have one file per virtual station**. We can now transfer them to the Pi.

- **Transfer** each station to the Pi with `scp STATION_NAME.mp3 pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/audio/`
- To choose **the order in which the stations will be played** next to each other, `ssh` into your Pi and rename the stations following the **alphabetical order** (e.g. prefix them with numbers to choose the order)

> The virtual radio software reads the audio folder in alphabetical order and assigns virtual frequencies by following this order.

## All done üëè

Run `sudo reboot` from your Pi and **it should start after a few seconds** depending on the amount of files/stations that you have transfered.

Before unplugging the Pi power cord, run `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local sudo shutdown -h now` or you might corrupt the SD card. For the bad guys over here, if you don't plan to do it anyway, at least unplug it when the Pi green LED isn't bliking ‚Äî meaning the micro-SD card isn't being wrote on, meaning there is less chance to corrupt it.

You can also [make Raspbian read-only](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adafruits-read-only/), which I'll try soon and maybe add to the installation script later on.

If everything runs perfectly, **I strongly suggest you to backup your micro-SD** card in an image to be able to restore it in case it gets corrupted.

### Troubleshooting

If the radio doesn't start on boot:
- Check that the script is launched with `ps aux | grep python`
- See that *pulseaudio* is launched with `ps aux | grep pulse`
- Try to launch the script yourself and see if it prints errors with `python2 /home/pi/app/src/main.py`

I'd be happy to help either on Twitter [@raphaelyancey](https://twitter.com/raphaelyancey) or on Github if you think the issue is related to either [Virtual_FM_Band](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/Virtual_FM_Band) or [pyKY040](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/pyKY040).
